# TOAST: Topological Algorithm for Singularity Tracking

## Installation

Our code has been tested with Python 3.8 and Python 3.9 under Mac OS
X and Linux. Other Python versions *may* not support all dependencies.

The recommended way to install the project is via [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/).
If this is available, installation should work very quickly:

    $ poetry install

Recent versions of `pip` should also be capable of installing the
project directly:

    $ pip install .
